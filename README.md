## Coffee lister

This is a simple project for a web app where the user can save, list and search their favorite coffee types.
The app uses a React / TypeScript front-end and a Node / express back-end with a MongoDB database.

### Installation:
*Prerequisites*
- Node.js (The assignment description allowed the use of React so I assume this is fine)

(Local mongoDB installation is not needed as the app uses a cloud MongoDB instance.)

Go to the directory where you want the project and use one of the following commands to clone the git repository:

HTTPS:
`git clone https://github.com/jannejjj/coffee-lister.git`

SSH:
`git clone git@github.com:jannejjj/coffee-lister.git`

## Running the code

1. Run the `npm install` command in the root directory of the project, and both the `/server` and `/client` directories.

In the root directory of the project:

2. `npm run dev:server` to start the back-end.
3. (in a separate terminal window) `npm run dev:client` to start the front-end.
4. The application will then be running at localhost:3000.
